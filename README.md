<details id="ex-1">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 1: Create and Append Elements</strong></summary>

Copy the example below:

```html
<!-- The DOM -->
<body>
  <h1>THE TITLE OF YOUR WEBPAGE</h1>
  <div id="container">
    <div class="content">This is the glorious text-content!</div>
  </div>
</body>
```

 To make it work, you’ll need to supply the rest of the HTML skeleton and either link your JavaScript file or put the JavaScript into a script tag on the page. Make sure everything is working before moving on!

Add the following elements to the container using ONLY JavaScript and the DOM methods shown above:

1. a `<p>` with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
2. an `<h3>` with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
3. a `<div>` with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
 *  another `<h1>` that says “I’m in a div”
 *  a `<p>` that says “ME TOO!”



💡  **Hint:**  After creating the `<div>` with createElement, append the `<h1>` and `<p>` to it before adding it to the container.

<details id="ex-2">
  <summary><strong>Exercise 2: Append and Style Elements </strong></summary>

Copy the example below, supply the rest of the HTML skeleton and link your JavaScript file.

```html
<body>
  <h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
  <div id="container">
    <div class="initial-content">This is the starting point.</div>
  </div>
</body>
```
**Tasks:**
  
  1. Get the `<div>` with the id "container".  

  2. Create a new `<p>` element with the text "This text is light green." and set its color to 'lightgreen'.

  3. Create a new `<h2>` element with the text "This is an orange heading." and set its color to 'orange'.

  4. Create a new `<div>` element. Give it a '2px solid black' border and a 'lightblue' background color.
  
  5. Inside this new `<div>` create:

  - a new `<h4>` element with the text "I'm the first element in the new div."

  - a new `<p>` element with the text "And I'm the second!"
  
  6. Append all the newly created elements to the "container" div in the correct order.
